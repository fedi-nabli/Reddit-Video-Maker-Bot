# Reddit Video Maker Bot ðŸŽ¥

All done WITHOUT video editing or asset compiling. Just pure âœ¨programming magicâœ¨.

## Motivation ðŸ¤”

These videos on TikTok, YouTube and Instagram get MILLIONS of views across all platforms and require very little effort.
The only original thing being done is the editing and gathering of all materials...

... but what if we can automate that process? ðŸ¤”

## Disclaimers ðŸš¨
